        <h2>We are not perfect. We are Human.</h2>
        <p>We screw up and sometimes we do stupid things. But we learn and evolve. We overcome and move on. Please forgive us and understand that we are doing our best. We are improving every day. We are outdoing ourselves.</p>
        <h2>Value is what we have to offer.</h2>
        <p>You won't pay any luxury tax here. We don't believe that. It is not the fact that a product is expensive that makes it good or bad, beautiful or ugly. It's not the price that makes an article unique. We don't mind selling 30%, 50% or 90% cheaper than our competition. The greater the difference between us and the competition, the more value we are offering you.</p>
